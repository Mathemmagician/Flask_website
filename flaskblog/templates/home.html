    	<h2> Hi and Welcome, wonderer!</h2>
    	<p> We have been waiting for you. As you can see, we are 
    	still in the construction stage of development, but don't worry, there are
    	still many things you can check out: </p>


    	<p> 1. Click around, <strike>some</strike> most links even point to things! </p>
    	
    	<p> 2. Check out the blog section, that's where <strike> most of the information is! </strike> </p>

        <p> 2.5 Blog now contains technical mambo jambo and messages and passing by strangers, such as yourself</p>
        
        <p> 2.75 The information can now be found everywhere, but definitely check out <a href="/projects/academic">Academic </a> and <a href="/projects/development">Development</a> in Projects </p>
    	
        <p> 3. Say hi! Create an account (but please use a throw away password since I do not want
    	to be responsible in case my database is not well secured, <strong>which it should be</strong>, 
    	but you know), and write a post! </p>

    	<p> 4. The Cake Is a Lie. </p>

    	<p> 6. If you find any unexpected features (<i>bugs</i>) since there isn't 
    		yet a <i>report bug</i> section, just <strike>write about it in
    		 a post</strike> <i>use the now working <a href="/contact">Contact </a> form </i> and I'll get to it.</p>
